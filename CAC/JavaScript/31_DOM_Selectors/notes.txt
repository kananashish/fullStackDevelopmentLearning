.innerText -> displays only the portion which is visible to the browser

.innerContent -> displays the portion which is present in html even if it is not visible to the browser

.innerHTML -> displays entire html code including the tags used.

NodeList and HTML Collection are not pure array. Arrays' prototype gives access to map functionality which is lacking in these two.
